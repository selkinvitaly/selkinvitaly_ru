          p Hi! I am Selkin Vitaly. I am a programmer with 4 years of IT experience primarily in Javascript technologies. I <i>believe</i> that <b>team</b> and <b>product</b> are important criteria in IT. I know what is <i>underestimated tasks</i>, tons of legacy, <i>team building</i>, <i>interviewing candidates</i>, because I have experience in position of <b>teamlead</b>.

          p Initially I used <abbr title="Koa + Angular + Node + Mongo">KOAN</abbr> stack, but now actively use <b>React</b>, <b>Typescript</b>, <b>Node.js</b> in my work. I <i>believe</i> that many things <i>can be automated</i> for the team to work <b>more effectively</b>. Therefore, I always look for ways to improve. I don't like phrase <i>'impossible'</i>, but prefer <i>'we will try'</i>. I'm not afraid to make mistakes, because I think that the main thing is to <b>correct your mistakes</b> quickly.

          p In my free time I am interested in other technologies.
